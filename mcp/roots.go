/* Roots */

// ListRootsRequest is sent from the server to request a list of root URIs from the client. Roots allow
// servers to ask for specific directories or files to operate on. A common example
// for roots is providing a set of repositories or directories a server should operate
// on.
//
// This request is typically used when the server needs to understand the file system
// structure or access specific locations that the client has permission to read from.

// This result contains an array of Root objects, each representing a root directory
// or file that the server can operate on.
